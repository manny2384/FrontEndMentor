## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to use JSX and REACT a lot more by taking this challenge. Some of the concepts were inline css such as the following 

```html
  <div className="specs">
    <span style={{"color": '#00FFF8'}}> <img src={ethereum} alt="ethereum" /> 0.041 ETH </span>
    <span> <img src={clock} alt="clock" /> 3 days left </span>
  </div>

```


### Continued development

One of my realizations is was that it's easy to style for one screen/platform, but creating a responsive layout takes more practice. Which I plan to continue as I take on more challenges.
